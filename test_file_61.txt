I'veI;veThis is a test of the text editor.

I've used both backspace and enter

Notes:
Enter doesn't work properly on ht the first enter
Backspeaace is very weird and seems to sometimes not peroproperly delete cahharacters, and sometimes places the cursor on the line above


Enter also seems to sometimes jump above instead of below
Good news is the same ave line overflow works without any effort from my part
