# Todo:

- [ ] Create a parent class for text contents, and then pseudo-inherit this for command vs file contents?
- [ ] Probably need to come up with a better way to run commands
- [ ] Fix backspace
- [ ] Fix arrow keys
- [ ] Fix backspace across lines
- [ ] Look into preventing the automatic overflow for characters to handle it within the text editor (i.e. overflow y, line break, etc)
- [ ] Automatically resize text across lines
